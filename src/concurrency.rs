// src/concurrency.rs

//! Concurrency utilities: Python-visible thread-safe wrapper around `AnnIndex`.
//!
//! This module exposes a `ThreadSafeAnnIndex` that allows concurrent, thread-safe
//! usage of the approximate nearest neighbor index from Python via PyO3.
//!
//! Internally, the index is protected by a `RwLock` so reads (searches) can happen
//! concurrently, while writes (add/remove) are exclusive.

/// - Concurrent reads (e.g., multiple searches in parallel)
/// - Exclusive writes (e.g., add/remove operations)
///
/// This allows safe concurrent access from multiple Python threads or async contexts.
